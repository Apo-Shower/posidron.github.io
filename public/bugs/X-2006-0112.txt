I. BACKGROUND

iTunes is a digital media player application, introduced by Apple on
January 10, 2001 at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, for playing and
organizing digital music and video files.

iTunes Library songs can be shared over a local network using the closed,
proprietary Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP), created by Apple for
this purpose.
